						 <p>Two weeks ago, the same day my original blog died, I went to the 2015 Robot Block Party in Silicon Valley.  I saw a lot of remote controlled robots, but the ones that grabbed my attention the most were the two non remote controlled ones.  One person was displaying a robot guide that would allow blind people to walk safely by beeping and vibrating when people were either 2, 4, or 8 meters away from them depending on their setting choice.  Here's a picture of what it looks like.</p>
