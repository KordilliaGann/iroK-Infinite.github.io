						 <p>Yesterday was my birthday, and because of that my dad gave me a robot a few days ago.  It's really cool, it rolls around, can be programmed in pretty much any language, and has multiple sensors.  The only downside about the sensors is that a front one doesn't really work.  We also went to Cork and Plough for lunch and saw Antman.  Based on the title my dad and I expected it to be totally ridiculous, but luckly it was actually pretty cool and his powers were fun like most marvel movies.</p>
